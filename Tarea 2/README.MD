# Tarea 2


**Warning**: Due to large size of file `Tarea 2, Oscar Herrera.xlsx` because of stochastic processes Monte Carlo simulations, this may cause an application hang, system freeze or even difficulties to open the file on some devices.

**This assignment is the core homework of the course.**

Contents:
- Term Deposit Mark to Market.
- Yield Curve Monte Carlo simulations.
    - Vasicek/Ho-Lee models for interest rates.
    - Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model for interest rates.
    - Correlated Brownian motions for interest rates (Multi-factor Vasicek/Multi-factor Hull-White models).
- Interest Rates interpolation.
- Risk measures via Monte Carlo.
- Leveraged Fixed Income Portfolio valuation.
- Duration (interest rates sensibility).
- Value at Risk.
- Portfolio VaR Hedging with Forwards.

Note:
- For every interaction with Excel file, simulations might be generated randomly again.
