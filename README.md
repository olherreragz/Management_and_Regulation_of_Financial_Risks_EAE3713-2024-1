**Note:** Assignments answers will be released in `python` in the near future to improve extensibility, scalability and replicability of the exercise, similar to the codes already available at [https://github.com/olherreragz/Econometric_Theory_III_EAE4103-2024-2/](https://github.com/olherreragz/Econometric_Theory_III_EAE4103-2024-2/) repository. After that, future versions in Jupyter Notebook will be released to facilitate visualization of results.
